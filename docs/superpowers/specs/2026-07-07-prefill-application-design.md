# Prefill application (Greenhouse) — design

**Date:** 2026-07-07
**Status:** Approved (brainstorming) — ready for implementation plan
**Branch:** `greenhouse-prefill-application`

## Problem

The application panel has a **"Prepare application"** button that, for any job, generates
a tailored résumé **and** a cover letter and (Greenhouse only) fetches the posting's
question schema and LLM-prefills it — then persists all of it as an
`application_packages` row.

Two problems:

1. **Unclear + cost-opaque.** "Prepare application" doesn't tell the user what it does or
   that it spends LLM budget on their behalf. It always generates a cover letter even
   though most postings never ask for one — a wasted, charged generation.
2. **Greenhouse question fetch happens per-user, on demand.** The posting's question
   schema is job-level data (identical for every user), but today it's re-fetched on every
   user's Prepare and stored per-package. It also can't be shown until the user prepares.

## Goals

- Replace the vague "Prepare application" button with an explicit, Greenhouse-only
  **"Prefill application"** action.
- Generate a cover letter **only when the posting actually asks for one** (detected from
  the real question schema), routed through the existing cover-letter pipeline.
- Move the Greenhouse question fetch to **poll time** (job-level, shared across users),
  and surface the question list on every Greenhouse job **before** any LLM spend.
- Use the **generated** tailored résumé (not the profile résumé) as the source for
  prefilled answers, so drafted answers match the résumé the user submits.

## Non-goals

- Question schemas for non-Greenhouse ATSes (Greenhouse-only, as today).
- Periodic re-fetch of question schemas (fetch once per job; the live form is the source
  of truth).
- Changing the cover letter's résumé input (it keeps using profile résumé text, matching
  the standalone cover-letter button).
- Dropping the now-unused columns in this change (deferred; see Cleanup).
- Any change to review/poll cadence beyond one extra per-new-job HTTP fetch.

## Key decisions

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| D1 | "Prefill application" is **Greenhouse-only**. Non-Greenhouse jobs show no such button; they keep the existing standalone résumé / cover-letter "Generate" buttons. |
| D2 | Prefill generates **résumé + prefilled answers**. A **cover letter is generated only if the posting's question schema asks for one**. |
| D3 | Prefill uses the **generated** tailored résumé (serialized via `composeResumeText`), not the profile résumé text. Résumé → prefill is therefore **sequential**. |
| D4 | **Résumé-failure behavior (a1):** if résumé generation fails, prefill is **skipped**; the user retries and both regenerate together. The cover-letter leg (if requested) runs in parallel and can still succeed. |
| D5 | Greenhouse question schema is fetched at **poll time** and stored **job-level** (shared) in a new `job_questions` table. Prefilled answers stay **per-user** in `application_packages`. |
| D6 | Poller fetch predicate is **"any open Greenhouse job with no `job_questions` row"** (not strictly new jobs), so the existing backlog **rolling-backfills** over subsequent polls. |
| D7 | The "Application questions" panel renders on every Greenhouse job, **collapsed by default** into a one-line summary, expandable. Apply stays the top primary CTA. |
| D8 | `application_packages.answers_snapshot` and `.greenhouse_questions` become **vestigial** (code stops reading/writing them); columns are **left in place** for now. A drop migration is deferred (a column drop is a separate two-phase deploy). |

## Architecture

### 1. Poll-time question fetch (Python)

New table (global job data — no `user_id`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE job_questions (
  job_id     TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  questions  JSONB NOT NULL,               -- GreenhouseQuestions shape (see below)
  fetched_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

Access posture mirrors `jobs`/`companies` (service/poller writes, authenticated reads).
It is **not** user-scoped, so the user-scoped deny-all RLS checklist does **not** apply.

The poller (`job_discovery/`) gains a step that, for each open Greenhouse job **lacking a
`job_questions` row**, calls
`GET https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{token}/jobs/{external_id}?questions=true`
(one call per job, once), parses it, and inserts a row when a usable question set exists.

- **Parser:** a Python twin of `parseGreenhouseQuestions`
  (`dashboard/lib/rolefit/greenhouseQuestions.ts`), colocated with
  `job_discovery/adapters/greenhouse.py`. It emits the **same JSON shape** the dashboard
  already parses:
  `{ questions: [{ label, required, fields: [{ name, type, options: [{ value, label }] }] }] }`.
- **Parser-parity guard:** a shared JSON fixture (a real Greenhouse `?questions=true`
  payload) is asserted by both the TS test and the Python test to produce identical
  parsed output, so the two parsers cannot drift.
- **Politeness/cost:** the fetch reuses `job_discovery/http.py` (`get_json`) and its
  existing retry/timeout behavior. Because the predicate is "missing row," the backlog
  is fetched once and then only truly-new jobs incur a call — bounded and self-limiting.

### 2. Data flow

- **Questions:** read job-level from `job_questions` (left-join when loading the board /
  job detail). Shared across users.
- **Prefilled answers:** stay per-user in `application_packages.prefilled_answers`.
- The panel already consumes the two separately via
  `mergeGreenhouseQuestions(questions, answers)` (`greenhouseAnswers.ts`), so no merge
  logic changes — only the **source** of `questions` moves from the package to the job.
- `application_packages.greenhouse_questions` is no longer written or read.

### 3. Prefill application route

Repurpose the existing route (`dashboard/app/api/application/prepare/route.ts`). The
internal route path and `generation_jobs.kind = 'prepare'` are **kept as-is** to avoid a
CHECK-constraint migration and existing-pending-row churn; only user-facing copy changes.
(A later rename to `'prefill'` is optional and out of scope here.)

Synchronous prologue (unchanged in spirit): auth, validation, config, profile/job load.
**Guard:** the route now returns 4xx for non-Greenhouse jobs (the button is Greenhouse-only,
but the API must enforce it too). It loads the job's `job_questions` row; if absent
(e.g. a brand-new job not yet backfilled), it fetches on demand via the existing
`fetchGreenhouseQuestions` (TS) and persists the result to `job_questions`, so Prefill
always works and the row is filled for the next viewer. If even the on-demand fetch yields
no usable schema, Prefill degrades to résumé-only (no answers, no cover).

**Charging (posting-driven):**
- Always reserve `resume`.
- Reserve `cover` **iff** the question schema contains a cover-letter ask.
- The prefill LLM call itself stays uncharged (as today).
- Any leg that fails is refunded (mirrors current per-leg refund + the outer catch).

**Background `after()` work:**

1. **Résumé leg:** `generateResume(...)` → on success, `composeResumeText(resume)` →
   `resumeTextForPrefill`.
   - Then, chained on success only, **prefill leg:** `generatePrefilledAnswers({ resumeText: resumeTextForPrefill, ... })`
     over the text questions **excluding** any cover-letter question.
   - Per **D4**, if the résumé leg fails, the prefill is skipped (no fallback to profile
     text), résumé is refunded, and the failure is surfaced for retry.
2. **Cover-letter leg (parallel, conditional):** only if a cover-letter ask is detected.
   `generateCoverLetter(...)` through the normal cover pipeline — persists
   `cover_letter_json` + `cover_letter_trace_id`, supersedes any prior edit, and feeds the
   cover-letter golden dataset. Uses profile résumé text (unchanged).
3. **Persist** via `upsertApplicationPackage`: résumé, prefilled answers, cover letter
   (when generated). **Not** written: `answers_snapshot`, `greenhouse_questions`.
4. Settle the tracking row (clean / partial / failed), mirroring today's semantics.

**Cover-letter detection** (on the raw `GreenhouseQuestions`, before `toPrefillQuestions`
strips file fields): a question is a cover-letter ask if any field's `name === "cover_letter"`
**or** the question `label` matches `/cover\s*letter/i`. Detected cover-letter questions are
excluded from the generic prefill set (so they are not double-answered) and instead drive
the cover-letter leg. Greenhouse's cover-letter field is usually `input_file`, which the
generic prefill already skips — so today it produces nothing; now it produces a real,
downloadable cover letter to attach.

### 4. UI (`ApplicationPanel.tsx`, `RolefitBoard.tsx`)

- **Header button:**
  - Non-Greenhouse: **no** Prefill/Prepare button. (Résumé + cover remain as their own
    standalone "Generate" panels.)
  - Greenhouse: **"Prefill application"** (label + copy make the action and its cost
    explicit). Standalone résumé/cover buttons remain for one-off regeneration.
- **Apply** remains the top primary CTA, unchanged.
- **"Application questions" panel:** renders on every Greenhouse job from `job_questions`,
  **collapsed by default** to a one-line summary — e.g. *"7 questions · cover letter
  requested · Prefill to draft answers"* — expandable to the full list. After prefill,
  answers fill in inside; unanswered required questions still show "Needs your answer."
  The collapsed default keeps job info and Apply from being buried.
- The header subtitle ("Tailored résumé and cover letter — ready for X") is updated to
  reflect the posting-driven behavior.

### 5. Cleanup

- Stop writing `answers_snapshot` (fully dead) and `greenhouse_questions` (moved
  job-level) in `upsertApplicationPackage` and its callers.
- Remove `answersSnapshot` from the `handleUnapply` `hasContent` OR-check in
  `RolefitBoard.tsx` (it never contributed a distinct outcome).
- Keep `applicationAnswersFromProfile` — the **live** profile projection is still used to
  surface reusable answers and as the profile-answers input to prefill. Only the persisted
  **snapshot** goes away.
- Columns are left in the schema (vestigial); a drop migration is a separate later change.

## Data model changes

- **New:** `job_questions (job_id PK → jobs ON DELETE CASCADE, questions jsonb, fetched_at)`.
  Add to `schema.sql` + a migration. Global-access posture (no RLS user scoping).
- **Vestigial (unchanged this round):** `application_packages.answers_snapshot`,
  `application_packages.greenhouse_questions` — no longer written/read.

## Testing

- **Parser parity:** shared fixture → identical `GreenhouseQuestions` from the Python and
  TS parsers.
- **Backfill predicate:** poller fetches for an open Greenhouse job with no `job_questions`
  row; skips one that already has a row; ignores non-Greenhouse jobs.
- **Cover-letter detection:** file-type `cover_letter` field and `/cover letter/i` labels
  both route to the cover pipeline and are excluded from generic prefill; absence generates
  no cover letter and reserves no `cover` slot.
- **Prefill input:** asserts the **generated** résumé text (not profile text) is fed to
  `generatePrefilledAnswers`.
- **Résumé-failure (D4):** résumé leg fails → prefill skipped, résumé refunded; cover leg
  (if requested) still persists.
- **Conditional charging:** `resume` always reserved; `cover` reserved iff a cover-letter
  question exists; failed legs refunded.
- **Data flow:** panel reads questions from `job_questions` and answers from the package;
  `mergeGreenhouseQuestions` output unchanged.
- **UI:** questions panel collapsed by default; Prefill button present on Greenhouse and
  absent on non-Greenhouse; API rejects Prefill for non-Greenhouse jobs.

## Rollout / deploy ordering

1. Apply the `job_questions` migration to Supabase **before** shipping code that reads it
   (migration-coupled-code discipline).
2. Deploy the poller change (backfill predicate) — the backlog begins filling on the next
   poll(s). The on-demand fallback in the route covers jobs not yet backfilled.
3. Deploy the dashboard change (route repurpose + UI). No column drop; nothing destructive.
4. (Later, separate) optional cleanup migration to drop the vestigial columns, sequenced
   **after** this code is deployed and soaked.

## Open questions

None blocking. Optional future work: rename the internal `prepare` route/kind to `prefill`
(requires a CHECK-constraint migration + pending-row handling); one-time backfill script if
the rolling backfill is too slow to fill the inventory.
